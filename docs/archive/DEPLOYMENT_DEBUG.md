## Current Status
- Navigation enhancements: ✅ Committed (75dc35f)
- Footer component: ✅ Committed (e368111) 
- Environment system: ✅ Committed (e368111)

## Expected Changes Not Visible
1. **Navigation improvements**:
   - Dropdown hover timing (300ms delay)
   - Updated Get Started button (cyan-500 to blue-600 gradient)
   - Removed voice navigation and system status
   - Enhanced accessibility features

2. **Footer component**:
   - Medical-grade footer with glass-morphism
   - Company information and trust indicators  
   - Contact details and legal links
   - Responsive design with animations

## Likely Issues
1. **Vercel Environment Variables Missing**:
   - NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL not set
   - NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY not set
   - NEXT_PUBLIC_SWELL_STORE_ID not set
   - NEXT_PUBLIC_SWELL_PUBLIC_KEY not set

2. **Build Cache Issues**:
   - Vercel may be using cached build
   - Components not updating despite code changes

## Immediate Fix
Add these demo environment variables in Vercel:
```
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL=https://demo.supabase.co
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=demo-key-12345
NEXT_PUBLIC_SWELL_STORE_ID=demo-store
NEXT_PUBLIC_SWELL_PUBLIC_KEY=demo-public-key
```
